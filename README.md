# EuchreMultiplayer
A recreation of the card game "Euchre" to be played in online multiplayer built in Unity, coded in C# and using PUN.
You can play the WebGL version at https://nathanielb123.itch.io/euchre-multiplayer-test

I worked on this for about a week. It is more-or-less feature complete now but may still have a couple bugs that need fixing/

This game uses Proton Unity Networking to handle a lot of the back-end online features.
This is my first proper game in Unity and using C# so the code is a bit of a mess, I might clean it up later.
